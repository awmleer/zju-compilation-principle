You probably haven’t heard of Gene Wolfe.
That’s too bad, because Neil Gaiman calls him “the finest living male American writer of SF and fantasy” and “possibly the finest living American writer.”
Wolfe has won many of speculative fiction’s most prestigious awards (including the Locus, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards), and some consider him the greatest writer of fantasy to have ever lived.
So why isn’t Wolfe more popular? One reason, I suspect, is that he doesn’t care. Wolfe doesn’t write for the average reader. In a letter to George R. R. Martin, Wolfe writes:
“My definition of a great story has nothing to do with ‘a varied and interesting background.’ It is: One that can be read with pleasure by a cultivated reader and reread with increasing pleasure.”
